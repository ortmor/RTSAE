            A Meeting Room is a dedicated space where people gather to conduct
            meetings, discussions, and collaborative activities. It is equipped
            with furniture, audiovisual tools, and technology to support
            effective communication and productivity. Meeting Rooms facilitate
            various purposes such as presentations, team meetings, training
            sessions, and brainstorming. With advancing technology, Meeting
            Rooms now enable remote participation and virtual collaboration,
